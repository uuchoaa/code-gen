To use a JSON schema for autocompletion in VS Code, you'll need to do the following:

1. **Install the YAML Extension**:
   - Install the [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) extension by Red Hat if you haven't already. This will allow VS Code to provide autocompletion for YAML files based on JSON schema.

2. **Save the Schema**:
   - Save the JSON schema to a file. For instance, you can name it `endpoint-schema.json`.

3. **Configure the YAML Extension**:
   - Open the settings in VS Code. You can do this by clicking on the gear icon in the lower left corner and selecting "Settings" or using the shortcut `Ctrl` + `,`.
   - In the top-right corner of the settings tab, you'll see an icon `{}` (Open Settings (JSON)). Click on it.
   - Here you can add or modify the JSON settings directly. Add the following to associate your YAML files with the schema:

```json
"yaml.schemas": {
    "path/to/endpoint-schema.json": ["*.yaml", "*.yml"]
}
```

Replace `path/to/endpoint-schema.json` with the actual path to your schema. The array `["*.yaml", "*.yml"]` determines which files the schema applies to. If you only want it to apply to a specific file or set of files, adjust the patterns accordingly.

4. **Enjoy Autocompletion**:
   - Now, when you edit a YAML file in VS Code that matches the patterns you've provided, the Red Hat YAML extension will use your schema to provide autocompletion and validation suggestions.

Remember: VS Code might require a restart (or just closing and reopening the YAML file) for the changes to take effect.

Note: Be aware of relative vs. absolute paths. If you're working on a specific project and the schema is part of that project, a relative path is more portable. If you're setting up a global configuration, then an absolute path might be more appropriate.
