# TO DO

The output is not production ready (at least can be better!). A good way to measure how accurate the system can be is defining the output usage (should be something useful!). For now we can build the `swagger.yml` to be use as api documentation. Later can generate some mocks (api and components) to improve (or unblock!) the front end development.

# Next big steps

- [ ] generate a mock api in Sinatra
- [ ] generate a mock api service component in Vue 2
- [ ] one-click api deploy?
- [ ] rails engine?
